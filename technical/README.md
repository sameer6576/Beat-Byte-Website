# ByteBeat

The Project is called ByteBeat a combination website of both techy world and cultural world.
Our website is divided into two parts :

1. The Contests and
2. The Fests
   Inside the Contests website :

Our website lets you see the details of all the hackathons existed whether they are :

1. Upcoming
2. Ongoing
3. Past
   We fetch this data using kontests api which is an open source api using javascript and ajax .
   Which is then sourced to our own website.

The 2nd part of our website lets you see the details of all the upcoming and Ongoing Fests near you .
This is hardcoded using html ,css and bootstrap but is extensible in the future using related apis.
The responsiveness of the website is still under development with the fest website being completely at the moment.

This Project is future extensible and will be constantly improved in the coming days.
